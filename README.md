# SpeedRun+
**SpeedRun+** (_SpeedRunPlus_) is a plugin for Minecraft (1.16.1) multiplayer servers which provides several speedrun-related
game modes to your server. **SpeedRun+** manages isolated, temporary worlds when speedrunning and supplies a range
of quality of life utilities such as: In-game timers, AFK detection, leaderboards, filtered seeds, and more. Game 
modes include:

- **Solo** - A classic single-player speedrun where you aim to defeat the Ender Dragon in the shortest time possible.
- **Battles** - A head-to-head race between two players in identical worlds. Each player rushes to defeat the Ender Dragon first — the first to do so wins the match.
- **Co-op** - A cooperative speedrun for up to two players sharing the same world. The run ends when the team defeats the Ender Dragon together.

With more coming!

A great solution for providing fun and competitive game modes to a proxy-based server network
([Velocity](https://github.com/PaperMC/Velocity) / [BungeeCord](https://github.com/SpigotMC/BungeeCord))
or simply on a _1.16.1_-native server!

## ️🛠️ Configuration & Permissions
**SpeedRun+** is highly configurable, allowing server owners to fine-tune game rules, world generation, timer behavior,
AFK handling, podiums to display top leaderboard contestants, and more. All settings can be adjusted through the
plugin’s `config.yml`, giving you control over how speedruns operate on your server.

Below is a complete example configuration file to help you understand the available options and their default values.
You can use this as a reference when customizing your own setup.

### 🔑 Permissions
**SpeedRun+** includes a set of permissions, that integrate seamlessly into [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/), and let
server owners control which features and gamemodes players can access. Most servers will likely grant _solo_, _battle_,
or _co-op_ permissions based on player ranks, while administrative permissions should be reserved for staff.

Below is a brief overview of permissions, but be sure to see the `plugin.yml` for the full list:

| Permission   | Description                                         | Default |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `srp.use`    | Allows the player overall usage of **SpeedRun+**    | _True_  |
